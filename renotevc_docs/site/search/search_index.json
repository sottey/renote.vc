So, theming. Theme file A theme file can live in your home data directory (~/.rvc/redovc) and it will be used as the default. You can also have theme files in other directories and when you are in that directory, that theme will be used. The theme file must be named .todos.theme.json and the contents are used to describe how different sections of the redovc list command presents data. Theme file color structure You can find sample theme files in the sampleThemes directory of the source code. For each section, there are a number of properties: Desc - Color of group names when group: is specified Name - Name of section. These are used by the code and must be one of: groupTitleColor - Color of group names when group: is specified noteIDColor - Color of note id's when --notes is used noteTextColor - Color of note contents when --notes is used taskIDColor - Color of a task id taskIDPriColor - Color of a task id if the task is prioritized completedColor - Color of completed indicator ([ ] or [X]) statusColor - Color of task status statusPriColor - Color of a task status if task is prioritized informationColor - Color of area indicating Priority, Note and Archived todayColor - Color of a task due today todayPriColor - Color of a task due today if that task is prioritized tomorrowColor - Color of a task due tomorrow tomorrowPriColor - Color of a task due tomorrow if that task is prioritized overdueColor - Color of a task that is overdue overduePriColor - Color of a task that is overdue if that task is prioritized otherDue - Color of a task that is not today, tomorrow or overdue otherDuePriColor - Color of a task that is not today, tomorrow or overdue if the task is prioritized taskTextColor - Color of task text taskTextProjectWordColor - Color of project names in task text taskTextTagWordColor - Color of tags in task text taskTextPriColor - Color of task text if the task is prioritized taskTextProjectPriWordColor - Color of project names in task text if that task is prioritized taskTextTagWordPriColor - Color of tags in task text if that task is prioritized Color - The color to be used.
